     * ## Part 1 - Populating the model
     * 
     * 1. Your company sells products to three different markets and uses four
     * channels. You can create your own names of the company, markets and channels.
     * 
     * 2. You sell more than thirty different products, pricing them differently for
     * different markets. You are also using different channels to reach your
     * customers.
     * 
     * 3. Every quarter your advertising agency gives you a breakdown of advertising
     * costs, for each market and by each channel. Link to advertising expense
     * table:
     * (https://northeastern-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/

     * 4. Autogenerate sales orders and randomly pick the following:
     * - Solution Offer
     * - Market
     * - Channel
     * - Price

     * ## Part 2 â€“ Build reports
     * 
     * 1. Create Market profitability report. This report should show how same
     * product sold under different solution offers performed in different Markets.
     * You should show total sales revenues as well as advertising costs and profit.
     * 
     * 2. Create Channel profitability report. This report should show which channel
     * was easier to sell, required less advertising budget and still sold well.
     * 
     * 3. Advertising Efficiency. This report should do a breakdown of the
     * advertising budget for the solution offers sold in each market sold through
     * each channel. Create a way to allocate Advertising costs and show the results
     * in a table.
     * 
     * 4. Implement a user interaction where the user (with Admin role) can choose
     * from list of reports and see the report.
     * 
     * ## Part 3 - User Interaction
     * 
     * 1. Implement a user interaction through the terminal.
     * 2. The user can choose options from menus and pick its own choices.
     * 3. Implement the following features:
     * - User can identify (or pick) its profile with Market and Channel choices.
     * - User will see an advertisement based on the choices above.
     * - User can see list of available solution offers and prices and can choose
     * one or more to add to a shopping cart.
     * - User can complete the purchase and get order confirmation.
     * 
     * 4. Add any additional features you think will improve user experience
